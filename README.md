Candy Crush is a popular match-three puzzle game that challenges players to match candies of the same color to clear them from the game board. In this tutorial, we will create a Candy Crush game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML will provide the structure for our game board, CSS will handle the visual styling and layout, and JavaScript will handle the game's logic and interactivity.

Throughout this tutorial, we will cover the following steps:

Setting up the HTML structure: We will create the necessary HTML elements to represent the game board and the candies on it. Each candy will be represented by a div element, and the game board will be a grid-like structure.

Styling the game elements with CSS: We will use CSS to style the candies, game board, and other visual elements. This will allow us to create a visually appealing and responsive game interface.

Generating and displaying candies: Using JavaScript, we will generate random candies and display them on the game board. Each candy will have a specific color and value associated with it.

Implementing candy swapping: We will enable players to swap adjacent candies by clicking on them. JavaScript will handle the logic for swapping candies and checking for matching combinations.

Handling candy matching and scoring: JavaScript will detect matching combinations of candies and remove them from the game board. We will update the player's score based on the number of candies cleared.

Implementing game logic: We will implement additional game mechanics, such as time limits, level progression, and special candies (if desired). JavaScript will manage these aspects of the game and handle game over conditions.

Game over and restart functionality: We will implement game over conditions, such as running out of time or moves. Players will have the option to restart the game after a game over.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Candy Crush game that can be played in a web browser. Let's get started by setting up the HTML structure and styling the game elements using CSS.
